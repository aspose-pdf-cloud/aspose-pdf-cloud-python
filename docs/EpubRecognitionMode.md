# EpubRecognitionMode
When PDF file (that usually has fixed layout) is being converted,
            the conversion engine tries to perform grouping and multi-level analysis to restore
            the original document author's intent and produce result in flow layout.
 This property tunes that conversion for this or that
            desirable method of recognition of content.
